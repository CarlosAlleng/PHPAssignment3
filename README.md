Project 15-1:	Improve validation 

For the Manage Customers application, improve the data validation so it uses the techniques described in chapter 15. (Required reading: chapters 1-6, 14, and 15) 

The View/Update Customer page 

 

Operation 

    Same as 6-3, but with data validation for all fields on the View/Update Customer page. 

Specifications 

    All fields except for phone are required. 

    The first name, last name, address, city, and state must have at least 1 and less than 51 characters. 

    The postal code must have at least 1 and less than 21 characters. 

    The password must have at least 6 and less than 21 characters. 

    The phone number must be in the (999) 999-9999 format. 

    The email address must be a valid email address. 

    You donâ€™t need to validate the country field since the drop-down list requires the user to select a valid country.
